# **SIDI-CLI**

**SIDI** is a user-friendly CLI tool designed to streamline the creation of YAML files for **testing**, **building**, and **deploying** mobile projects on **Bitrise** and **Codemagic**.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

**SIDI** simplifies CI/CD setup by guiding you through the creation of optimized YAML configuration files.  
It ensures:
- **No duplicate steps**
- **Consistent workflows**
- Automatic injection of required keys and configurations.

With SIDI, you'll answer a few questions about your project and desired CI/CD setup, and it will do the heavy lifting for you!

## üåü Why Use SIDI?

Setting up a project from scratch on CI/CD platforms like Bitrise and Codemagic can be complex and time-consuming. Each platform uses unique workflows, making it harder to manage as the number of workflows grows.  

**SIDI** makes the process:
- **Easier**: Automates YAML file creation and updates.
- **Faster**: Generates optimized configurations tailored to your needs.
- **Flexible**: Enables seamless switching between Bitrise and Codemagic.

With SIDI, you can:
- Quickly create and configure YAML files.
- Update YAML configurations to the latest standards.
- Maintain consistency across CI/CD setups.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

**SIDI** asks a series of questions about:
- **Project Details**:
  - Type: Native Android, Native iOS, or React Native.
  - Application or Library.
  - CI/CD platform: Bitrise or Codemagic.
- **Workflows**:
  - Workflow names.
  - Steps to include or exclude.

### Output Files:
1. **Main YAML File**: The core configuration for your CI/CD platform.
   - **Important**: This file should not be manually edited. Use `sidi-cli u` for updates.
   - For Bitrise, copy/paste the content into the platform. For Codemagic, push the file directly.
2. **Secret File**: Contains keys required for builds.
   - Fill in the required values to ensure a successful build.
   - Refer to the [purposed steps documentation](./docs/purposedSteps.md) for details.
